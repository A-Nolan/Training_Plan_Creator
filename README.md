# Training_Plan_Creator

Every week I spend roughly two hours creating a Training Plan for my restaurant.

The object of the project is to help automate this process and cut it down into only a couple of minutes.

## Tasks

- [x] Scrape schedule data from MySchedule and save it into an Excel file `schedule.xlsx`
- [ ] Check which employees need training this week from `Training Plan.xlsx`
    - [ ] Prioritise `Hygiene & Food Safety` and `Health & Safety` SOCs
    - [ ] Prioritise employees who have completed the least amount of SOCs
- [ ] Check which SOC the employee needs to do from `Suggested_SOCs.xlsx` file downloaded from PeopleStuff
    - [ ] Prioritise `Hygiene & Food Safety` and `Health & Safety` SOCs
    - [ ] Generally take the first SOC from the list, but may change due to employee e.g CEL wouldn't work in the kitchen
